/*
 * An interface with exactly one abstract method is known as Functional Interface.
 * A new annotation @FunctionalInterface has been introduced to mark an interface as Functional Interface. @FunctionalInterface annotation is a facility to avoid accidental addition of abstract methods in the functional interfaces. 
 * It’s optional but good practice to use it.
 * 
 * The major benefit of java 8 functional interfaces is that we can use lambda expressions 
 * to instantiate them and avoid using bulky anonymous class implementation.
 * 
 * Java 8 Collections API has been rewritten and new Stream API is introduced that uses a lot of functional interfaces. 
 * Java 8 has defined a lot of functional interfaces in java.util.function package. 
 * Some of the useful java 8 functional interfaces are Consumer, Supplier, Function and Predicate.
