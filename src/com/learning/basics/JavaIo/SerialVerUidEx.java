 * Serialization in java permits some changes in the java class if they can be ignored. Some of the changes in class that will not affect the deserialization process are:

Adding new variables to the class
Changing the variables from transient to non-transient, for serialization it’s like having a new field.
Changing the variable from static to non-static, for serialization it’s like having a new field.

But for all these changes to work, the java class should have serialVersionUID defined for the class

 * The reason is clear that serialVersionUID of the previous class and new class are different. Actually if the class doesn’t define serialVersionUID, 
 * it’s getting calculated automatically and assigned to the class. Java uses class variables, methods, class name, package etc to generate this unique long number. 
 * If you are working with any IDE, you will automatically get a warning that “The serializable class Employee does not declare a static final serialVersionUID field of type long”.
