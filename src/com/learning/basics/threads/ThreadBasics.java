	 * Process vs Thread
	 * A process is a self contained execution environment and it can be seen as a program or application.
	 * However a program itself contains multiple processes inside it. 
	 * Java runtime environment runs as a single process which contains different classes and programs as processes.
	 * 
	 * Thread can be called lightweight process. 
	 * Thread requires less resources to create and exists in the process, thread shares the process resources.
	 */
	
	/*
	 * Thread Exmaple:
	 * Every java application has at least one thread – main thread. 
	 * Although there are so many other java threads running in background like memory management, system management, signal processing etc.
	 * But from application point of view – main is the first java thread and we can create multiple threads from it.
	 * 
	 * Multithreading refers to two or more threads executing concurrently in a single program.
	 * A computer single core processor can execute only one thread at a time and time slicing is the OS feature to share processor time between different processes and threads.
	 * 
	 * Thread Benefits:
	 * Java Threads are lightweight compared to processes, it takes less time and resource to create a thread.
	 * Threads share their parent process data and code
	 * Context switching between threads is usually less expensive than between processes.
	 * Thread intercommunication is relatively easy than process communication
	 *

	 * 1.Implementing Runnable interface
	 * 2. Extending thread class

	/*
	 * To make a class runnable, we can implement java.lang.Runnable interface and provide implementation in public void run() method. 
	 * To use this class as Thread, 
	 * we need to create a Thread object by passing object of this runnable class and then call start() method to execute the run() method in a separate thread.
